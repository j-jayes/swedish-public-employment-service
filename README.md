# Swedish Public Employment Service scraper

## Purpose

The Swedish Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen or public employment service provides job advertisements on a website.

As an institution it has advertised jobs since 1902. I want to digitize some of its archive and then check for a persistence in perhaps skill level by region. Other interesting questions would be to look at advertised wage levels over time and see how these compare to recorded levels from other sources.

As part of this project I will need to have a record of the current adverts - hence this scraper. The ads on the website contain information on job sought, employer, specific title, area, scope, duration, employment type (fixed term vs permanent), qualifications required, description. On the employer there is an address, company profile and cntact person. there's an ad_id and dat of publication.

TODO: Describe ads further.

## Process

Try make a scraper in R, might have to use selenium. If it fails, go to python. 

## Planning

Could scrape daily to see how the dynamics of the market work - do this over time and see trends in seasonality - compare now vs in the past etc.
